A researcher, musician, philosopher, meditator.

My research began with curiosity about the connection between computers and music. In the recent years, my interests have shifted the development of software systems that transcend their use as mere tools to become computational partners in their social interaction with humans. The issues that surround the study, design, and evaluation of such systems involves tools and techniques from an array of disciplines relating to agent architecture design for real-time interaction, study of social interaction through the methods ethnographic analysis from social sciences, and user experience evaluation from the domain of human computer interaction.
