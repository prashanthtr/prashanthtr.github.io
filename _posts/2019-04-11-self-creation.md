The video is a short excerpt of playing by an autonomous version of the
synthetic music co-performer system.

Self-creating system in action

In this demonstration, the system constructs it’s own world
(actions+environment) through music/sound. It plays ( sequence of red dots),
listens to its own actions from the environment through a mic (yellow dots) and
responds to those actions by maintaining or changing its configuration (red
dots). I’d claim that it has a little self-creating action loop that keeps it
going. It is an offshoot of my phd work on building a synthetic music
co-performer.
